# paiz's Portfolio Repository

In my portfolio repository, Faiz Hazim Hawari, I've assembled a showcase of my creative exploits. It's a space where my design journey comes alive through an array of projects, spanning UI/UX designs, digital illustrations, and more. Each entry embodies my dedication to merging artistic innovation with technical expertise. Through this repository, I'm excited to share my journey of crafting compelling visual solutions that leave a lasting impact.
